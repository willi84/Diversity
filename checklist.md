# DiversityChecklist - It's more about linking a Code of Conduct

The following document collect my thoughts about creating a diverse and inclusive environment.
* Feel welcome to discuss and submit PRs
* Don't be scared about length - every step moving forward is a good step.

## General
* have a common understanding and goal of Diversity 
* being convinced of what you do (its not marketing!)
* create a safe enviroment
* diversity and inclusivness is not your enemy, its a toolset to create a great environment, great products and supports your community/event/business
* diversity is not just about more women


It's more about linking a Code of Conduct
## simple actions
* open your eyes and try to change to the others perspective
  * that you don't have a problem doesn't mean the problem doesn't exist
* create people friendly environment
  * gender free toilets (like home) with all useful sanitary articles for female and male health
* invite underrepresented people to your organizer group changes awareness of things (e.g. a women usually know better about the needs of other women for an inclusive environment)
* provide a dedicated "Care team" of trusted people for CoC
  * they help to to take care about code of conduct and diversity issues
  * provide not just random contact (like info@) or a male contact
* discuss issues
  * try to show people what they maybe have done wrong and also take their perspective  (esp. when it was really unintended)
  * convince people instead of forcing them
  * provide further material
  * give "wanted" feedback about diversity issues (ask if you can do!)
* stand up and take actions when violations happens
  * being context sensitive: being hyper pc can discourage people or start them to hate CoC/Diversity
  * don't correct them every minute 
  * make sure it was an intended violation
* empower other people
* avoid "men jokes", biases and mansplaining
* a tech event is not a dating platform
  * don't take nice behaviour or heart-smileys as a dating offer
* don't use diversity as marketing, advertisment, white listing tool or "nince to have"
* take care about what support offer, especially as an individual: "I pay your ticket" or "share with you a room if needed" can be meant nice but is often used for other purposes and so a "red line" http://www.cassandrahl.com/blog/working-while-female-sexual-harassment-in-technology-testing/
* take care about discussion topics
  * know your opposite and about their values
  * if you don't know your opposite: avoid any kind of topics/jokes that could be understood wrong (esp. about politics, gender, sex, religion)
    * sample: this is bad, very bad https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2hiIUeX0AEzH2z.jpg
  * if you know them & their values: well, it depends. in a safe environment where everybody know each other for sure you can talk also about other topics but make sure the others understand your purpose right
    * sample: I discovered disussions about sex toys in a safe enviroment where the purpose was a clear professional one. It was about femtech (technical products for women) 
* ask other people if you are not sure

# bigger actions
* have a real Code of Conduct you understand and breath
  * make people understand why its necessary but more why its also useful for them
  * be calm & respectful with people who don't understand a CoC (everybody needs its journey & learnings)
* provide necessary support
  * child care (often forgotten at events)
  * accessibility tools (voice-text-translation, language translation)
  * religious needs (like prayer room)
  * diverse food (vegan, vegetarian and also non-vegan)
  * scholarships
  * cheap tickets (make your event accessable to others)
* inclusive language: 
  * support gender free language 
  * don't harrasse people if they are not doing 100% right (like "*", "_", "/")
  * understand your target group: don't encode your message behind political full correct terms if your opposite don't understand it (a person from a small place in nowhere has different understanding then a full diverse city people)
  * don't harrase them, if they don't understand it
* CFP process
  * be transparent about the process (also about restrictions in budget or popular speaker)
  * open more to first time speaker (!)
  * look behind the talk: professional speaker know every buzzword they have to put in a successful CFP ;-)
  * support for speakers with disabilities
* presentations
  * use inclusive language and not like "our team has awesome guys"
  * use inclusive picture and don't suggest that its just a men's thing to program
  * review videos and Gifs (!) before using them
# useful articles

# other actions
* jobs
  * use inclusive job descriptions ( no bullshit list of technologies => a lot females don't apply if they don't fit to every point 150%)
  * dont hand out participants lists to 3rd parties

# background
* safe environment: a space where people trust each other and can speak frankly about issues not being judged; that sometimes also can mean its not a mixed group
* red lines and black lists: 
  * underrepresentated communities scan events about how serious CoC and other Diversity engagement is treated, if they are not convinced your event lands on a black list or is not recommended
  * take care about your actions, they can be understood wrong: http://www.cassandrahl.com/blog/working-while-female-sexual-harassment-in-technology-testing/
* if (s)he doesn't say anything it doesn't mean its ok
  * often people be quite about their harrassement
* live coc and not just put it because it is needed
* discuss issues with the people, for sure its hard to convince if the people are not aware of that
